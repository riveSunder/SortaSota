    "Hi. This is a tutorial about building a very simple multilayer perceptron to approximate the exclusive-or function, also known as the XOR function to its friends. It might also be your introduction to the Julia programming language. Developed for scientific computing, Julia is ostensibly something of a faster Python. One interesting feature of the language is that when you see a mathematical definition for a dense layer in a neural network, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "f(x) = \\sigma(\\theta_w x + b)\n",
    "$\n",

    "You can actually write code that looks very similar, thanks to Julia's support for unicode characters. It doesn't neccessarily save you any time typing (symbols are typed by entering the $\\LaTeX$ code, _e.g._ `\\sigma` and pressing tab), but it does look pretty cool. "

    "The difference between a test and validation dataset is immaterial when we're generating our data on demand as we are here. But normally you wouldn't want to go back and modify your training algorithm after running your model on a static test dataset. That sort of behavior runs a high risk of data leakage as you can keep tweaking training until you get good performance, but if stop only when the test score is good you'll actually have settled on a lucky score. That doesn't tell you anything about how the model will behave with actual test data that it hasn't seen before. This happens in the real world when researchers collectively iterate on a few standard dataset. Of course there will be [incremental improvement every year on MNIST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10498) if everyone keeps fitting their research and development strategy to the test set!\n",
